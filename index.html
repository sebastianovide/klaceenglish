          <p>Founder and Director Janice Phillips has been teaching since 1993 in four different countries.  Janice's Experience with students from very different cultures has taught her they all share the same peculiarity:  They learn much more when they have fun and when they use practically what they are learning.</p>

          <p>Janice has a passion for her work and an in-depth knowledge of the learning process. Janice notes, <em>"I understand students come from another country for two weeks into the UK aiming to have a great experience and improve their English in the process. They want to get the most from it in that short period of time that they will be here. For that reason I focus 100% on giving  them what they cannot get at home: incredible, practical experience that contributes to their personal growth."</em></p>

          <p>Ms. Phillips has taught at Dublin Four English, Chiswick School and The British International School. Ms. Phillips holds a Bsc with honors and a post graduate TEFL diploma from the Dublin Institute of Technology.</p>
