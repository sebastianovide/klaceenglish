          <p>Our program is for High school students from age 14 onwards. Our two-week program, based in London, and beginning in the summer of 2014, immerses students in practical, English-speaking environments and offers <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/educationalpsychology/a/experiential-learning.htm"> experiential-based learning</a>, including drama, debating, storytelling, public speaking and cultural immersion.
          </p>

          <p>Our program is based on a simple idea - learning by doing. And our results are proven. Unlike most typical English development courses, Klace allows students to take their classroom teachings to the next level. Students from diverse cultures are placed into exciting environments full of new experiences. Our two-week program provides total cultural immersion including exciting field excursions and hosting by English speaking families.
          </p>

          <p>To further suport our teaching methodologies, each classroom is equipped with the latest technological equipment, including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Board">SMART Board</a>. This innovative tool has been likened to an interactive whiteboard. Audio can easily be embedded into SMART Notebook lessons reinforces important or difficult vocabulary and expressions in an interactive manner. The SMART Response system gauges student comprehension of topics covered.

          <p>
          Klace's curriculum includes a well-balanced program of experienced-based learning activities, off-site excursions, and classroom studies. Experiential content includes drama exercises, storytelling, public speaking and debating. Exciting field excursions include visits to local parks, cafes and entertainment venues. These activities provide total cultural immersion, taking what the students learn from our interactive activities and the classroom and put their skills to practical use in real-world situations. And students find our classrooms spacious and bright with class size not exceeding 16 students. 
          </p>

          <p>
          As the main difference of Klace's Curriculum, our experiential course work allows students to do a deep dive into using English in ways normal classroom environments simply can't provide.

          <p>Founder and Director Janice Phillips has been teaching since 1993 in four different countries.  Janice's Experience with students from very different cultures has taught her they all share the same peculiarity:  They learn much more when they have fun and when they use practically what they are learning.</p>

          <p>Janice has a passion for her work and an in-depth knowledge of the learning process. Janice notes, <em>"I understand students come from another country for two weeks into the UK aiming to have a great experience and improve their English in the process. They want to get the most from it in that short period of time that they will be here. For that reason I focus 100% on giving  them what they cannot get at home: incredible, practical experience that contributes to their personal growth."</em></p>

          <p>Ms. Phillips has taught at Dublin Four English, Chiswick School and The British International School. Ms. Phillips holds a Bsc with honors and a post graduate TEFL diploma from the Dublin Institute of Technology.</p>
